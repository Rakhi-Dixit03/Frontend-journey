        <p>Bhagat Singh was not just a freedom fighter but a revolutionary thinker, 
            socialist, and one of the most influential voices of the Indian independence movement.
            Deeply inspired by Marxist ideologies, he dreamed of an India free from both colonial rule and social injustice. 
            As an atheist, he boldly challenged religious orthodoxy,
            advocating for rational thought and equality.</p>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>On Revolution</h3>
                <p>“Revolution is an inalienable right of mankind. Freedom is an imperishable birthright of all.”
                For Bhagat Singh, revolution wasn't limited to armed struggle,it meant a total transformation of society.
                He envisioned a world free of oppression,
                inequality, and exploitation, where justice and liberty prevailed.</p>

                    faith—not out of arrogance, but as a result of reason and intellectual honesty.
                     His atheism reflected his stand against communalism and sectarian violence that divided India.</p>

                     He envisioned a socialist India where wealth and power were not hoarded by a few, 
                     but equally shared among all especially workers, farmers, and the poor.
